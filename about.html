	    <h2>Who are the Regent Web Developers?</h2>
	    <p>This website was <b>hard-coded</b> by the amazingly talented Regent Web Developers, a clever group of 3 talented Y5 students: </p>
	    <br>
	    <h4> Jayden, Sasha & Aseem</h4>
	    <br>
	    <p>What started out as part of their <i> Y5 HTML5 lessons in Computing</i>, these 3 talented 10 year olds took coding a website to another level.  
		    They spent numerous hours learning advanced features of <b>HTML5</b> & then had to dip into the <i>Y6 lessons on <b>CSS3</b> </i>to format this website, mastering a great many advanced styling features.
		    They level of standards these 3 have produced reach into the secondary level.  It's a big challenge to use CSS3 to style every aspect of their website.
	  	    </p>
	    <br>
	    <p>Jayden, Sasha & Aseem have demonstrated excellent dedication & committment to produce a website for their peers in Shrek. They're pioneering the way for 
		    other students to develop <b>real-world application</b> of their learning & for a <b>real purpose.</b>  </p>
	<br>	    
	    <p> It's one thing to use Wordpress or Wix.com to create a very instantaneous website that's cool & flashy, but there's a <i>remarkable sense of pride</i> that comes 
	    with the all the hard work & countless efforts & many hours that went into building something from scratch.  That is why I've endeavoured to provide them with a live 
		    platform:  <b>21st Century kids publish!</b></p>
	    <br>
	    <p>They're applying their learning. They're applying their innovations!  <i>Imagine what our new Regent Secondary will do!</i></p>
	    <br>
	    <p><b>I am very proud of young web developers!</b></p>
	    <p>Mr E, <i>Head of Computing & Applied Innovations</p>
